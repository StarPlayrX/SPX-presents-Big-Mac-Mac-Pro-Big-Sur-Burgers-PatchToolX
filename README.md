#### Reminder to download 11.2.3 and keep it in safe place. This can be done from bigmac and check your /Users/Shared folder. ;)

### First Time User Guide (from an unsupported Mac)
* If running Bigmac2 recovery / install disk from OWC 2.5" SSD, use a 4x PCIe slot (on Mac Pro 3,1 use the 3rd PCIe slot, not the 1st or 2nd 16x slots)
* If Bigmac2 app does not run, try resigning it: `codesign --force --deep --sign - /Applications/bigmac2.app`
* If you have Bluetooth 2 EDR Card, remove it. You can reinstall it later after you run the Disable Bluetooth patch
* If you have not installed dosdude1's APFS ROM Patcher, do that first.
* If you want native WiFi and BT4, do yourself a huge favor and get a 802.11ac/BT4LE Broadcom black iMac style combo card. This will also give you Airdrop and Handoff without any weird hacks.
* Install BigMac 2 to an external hard drive or USB Flash thumb drive (should be relatively fast and min of 32 GB)
* Next disable SIP. Boot BigMac 2 up from an external USB 2.0 on an unsupported Mac:
  * `csrutil`
  * `csrutil disable`
  * `csrutil authenticated-root disable`

 * This should stop the Kill -9 errors users have been getting

 * BigMac2 should behave from the USB 2.0 disk and on Internal SSDs. If you ZAP your PRAM, repeat.

 * If you cannot disable SIP, do this from a Recovery Disk or Create install media disk.

### Installation from a Supported Intel Mac
  * Boot into Recovery: Cmd-R at boot
  * Open Terminal. These next steps are required to run BigMac2 and CloneToolX from a bigmac2 install disk from a Supported Mac:
    * `csrutil`
    * `csrutil disable`
    * `csrutil authenticated-root disable`

   * Download BigMac2 beta
   * if Bigmac2 app does not run, try resigning it: `codesign --force --deep --sign - /Applications/bigmac2.app`
   * Select install macOS Monterey beta 2
   * Boot from bigmac2
   * From the Springboard, launch bigmac2
   * From bigmac2's pre install tab, Launch the installer. In five seconds, the macOS installer will be shown.
   * Several reboots will happen
   * When welcome screen shows, shutdown.
   * Boot back into the bigmac2 intall disk
   * For Mac Pro 3,1 run the Telemtery post install by itself
   * Then for all systems, delete the APFS Snapshot by itself
   * Shutdown
   * Now see if the USB 2.0 install boots on your unsupported Mac (this will be slow)
   * If success, you can now clone your system to BigMac. Besure to remove the live snapshot on the clone using bigmac delete snapshot.
   * Install any other post install items from bigMac2 and also check Bless and update KCs.
  
### Monterey Beta 2 is Experimental
* This is what we know so far:
  * Legacy WiFi cards will not work. Upgrade to 802.11ac/BT4LE Cards
  * BlueTooth 4LE wth 20702 Cards are currently not working with Monterey Beta 3.
  * Will be testing an ASUS Bluetooth 5LE Card soon.
  * USB 2.0 devices will only work with a USB 3.0 Hub or Switch. This includes Apple USB 2.0 Devices!
  * If the progress bar boots slowly and not far, that usually means that it will boot up.
  * With Race Condition, a full system seems to boot better when not in Verbose mode. This could just be voodoo.
  * For AMD cards MouSSE is not needed. It's only needed on Mojave. I run an RX 580 8GB flashed and a Radeon Pro WX4100 non flashed. Neither need MouSSE. It will be removed from future versions of bigmac2.

## Recommended Flash Drive or a USB 2.0 / 3.0 SSD
For Big Mac 2 installer disks, I use Samsung Flash Drive FIT Media 32GB. Once you have disabled SIP and authenticated-root, you can install BigMac 2 to an internal SSD or Harddrive on a 32GB APFS Partition. Remember if you ZAP your PRAM, you'll need to use your USB 2.0 Drive instead.

## Here are some screenshots and notes
        Select your macOS version. Then to download it from Apple click "Download macOS"
